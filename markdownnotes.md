## Notes As I Make Project 2

* Added Must run as root (used from my old scripting 1 code)
* Added check to see if file exist or not* created for loop each one of the emails in the file
* Added $users which is used to get the usernames and used cut to get usernames to the left of the @ symbol
* Added $pass which uses openssl to create a random password. [Link to the snip of code I used](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/30184/10-ways-to-generate-a-random-password-from-the-command-line/)
